## List of contributors with avatars

To update the list, the script need to be run when change is merged to master and since all merges are done on
devel. I need to run the script when I'm releasing new version. To help me remember, if this is yours first
contribution, please modify template/Makefile.in and update line `UPDATE_CONTRIBUTORS=1` it should be 1 which
is true (0 is false). On each build it will show red reminder message and it will stop build when run on master.
